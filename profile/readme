Welcome to the Tau Consortium Bioinformatics Hub GitHub repository. This hub is dedicated to facilitating the use of large â€˜omics datasets for the discovery and development of treatments for tauopathy and related disorders. Our goal is to provide a centralized platform for sharing standardized pipelines, user-friendly tools, and educational resources to promote scientific collaboration and innovation within the Tau Consortium (TC) community and beyond.
